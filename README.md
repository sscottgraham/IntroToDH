# About
This course is a hands-on introduction to the history, theory, and practice of the [digital humanities](assets/dh_papers.png). In the humanities, we study how cultural context shapes how we create, understand, and interact with artifacts and systems. The digital in digital humanities signals two primary shifts in this framework: (1) attention to how cultural context shapes how we create, understand, and interact with digital artifacts and digital systems, and (2) digital inquiry into how cultural context shapes how we create, understand, and interact with artifacts and systems. This course engages both modes through a study of the digital humanities in its critical, archival, empirical, interventional, and experimental variants. The readings and assignments are designed to help students learn to evaluate the nature of digital humanities artifacts, projects, and scholarship through project-based exercises in creating and interpreting digital humanities resources, and a close (and critical) look at the infrastructural, institutional, and political issues involved in digital creation, analysis, dissemination, and preservation. As we look at the concepts, methods, and theories of digital humanities through the perspective of practice, we will not only consider how computational methods are being used to further humanities research and teaching but how the humanities can deepen our understanding of computational methods and infrastructures.
